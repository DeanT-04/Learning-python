Overall Codebase Explanation:

1. Environment Setup:
   - The script uses a .env file to store the API key securely.
   - The load_dotenv() function loads this key into the environment.

2. API Interaction (get_weather function):
   - Constructs a URL for the OpenWeatherMap API using the city name and API key.
   - Sends a GET request to this URL.
   - Parses the JSON response to extract relevant weather information.
   - Implements error handling for potential API request issues.

3. Data Processing:
   - Weather data for each city is stored in a dictionary format.
   - These dictionaries are collected in the all_weather_data list.

4. User Interaction:
   - The script allows users to add a country of their choice to the predefined list.

5. Data Persistence (save_to_csv function):
   - Collected weather data is saved to a CSV file.
   - Each entry in the CSV includes a timestamp of when the data was collected.

6. Main Execution Flow:
   - Starts with a predefined list of cities.
   - Adds user input to this list.
   - Iterates through the cities, fetching weather data for each.
   - Saves the collected data to a CSV file.

Key Variables:
- api_key: Stores the OpenWeatherMap API key (sensitive information).
- cities: List of cities to fetch weather data for.
- all_weather_data: List that stores weather data dictionaries for all cities.
- weather_data: Dictionary containing weather information for a single city.

This script demonstrates key programming concepts including API interaction, 
file I/O, error handling, and basic user interaction, all centered around 
the task of collecting and storing weather data.
